# linear_regression_model
This Jupyter Notebook contains code for a linear regression model that predicts a student's grade based on the number of hours they studied. The dataset used in this model contains information on the number of hours each student studied and the corresponding grade they received.

#Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to have Jupyter Notebook and Python installed on your computer. You can install Python and Jupyter Notebook by following the instructions on the official websites.

Once you have Jupyter Notebook and Python installed, you can open the Linear Regression Model.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook. This notebook contains all the code necessary to run the model, as well as detailed explanations of each step.
