# linear_regression_model
This Jupyter Notebook contains code for a linear regression model that predicts a student's grade based on the number of hours they studied. The dataset used in this model contains information on the number of hours each student studied and the corresponding grade they received.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, you need to have Jupyter Notebook and Python installed on your computer. You can install Python and Jupyter Notebook by following the instructions on the official websites.

Once you have Jupyter Notebook and Python installed, you can open the Linear_Regression_Model.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook. This notebook contains all the code necessary to run the model, as well as detailed explanations of each step.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this model is included in the notebook. It was downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubham47/students-score-dataset-linear-regression
The dataset contains two columns:
Hours: The number of hours each student studied.
Scores: The corresponding grade that the student received.


## Running the Model
To run the model, simply open the Linear_Regression_Model.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook and follow the instructions provided in the notebook. You can adjust the model parameters and input data as needed to test different scenarios.
